If money supply grows 5 percent and real GDP grows 4 percent what is the predicted inflation rate in the quantity theory,6 percent,0 percent,3 percent,1 percent,D,With roughly constant velocity inflation equals money growth minus real output growth so subtract real growth from money growth.
Human capital refers to,Skills knowledge and education embodied in workers,Financial wealth held by firms,Machines tools and structures,Natural resource endowments,A,Human capital increases the effectiveness of labour just as physical capital raises output by giving workers better tools.
If actual inflation turns out higher than expected who tends to gain and who tends to lose on fixed nominal loans,Neither side is affected because contracts are fully indexed,Borrowers gain and lenders lose because repayments have lower real value,Borrowers lose and lenders gain because repayments rise automatically,The government always gains and households always lose,B,Unexpected inflation erodes the real value of nominal repayments benefiting borrowers and harming lenders.
If the Reserve Bank lifts the OCR during a demand boom which short run outcome is most likely,Higher investment and faster demand growth,A permanent fall in the natural rate of unemployment,Lower investment and slower growth in aggregate demand,No effect on credit conditions,C,A higher policy rate passes through to market rates making borrowing costlier and moderating interest sensitive spending.
Purchasing power parity suggests that over time a country with persistently higher inflation will experience,No change in the exchange rate,Higher real exchange rate with no nominal change,Currency depreciation relative to trading partners,Currency appreciation to offset higher prices,C,Higher domestic prices reduce competitiveness so the nominal exchange rate tends to depreciate to align price levels long run.
The Fisher effect predicts that a sustained one percentage point rise in expected inflation will,Leave nominal and real rates unchanged,Lower real interest rates permanently,Lower nominal interest rates by one percentage point,Raise nominal interest rates by about one percentage point on average,D,Lenders demand compensation in nominal terms for expected inflation so nominal rates rise roughly one for one in the long run.
If actual inflation turns out higher than expected who tends to gain and who tends to lose on fixed nominal loans,The government always gains and households always lose,Borrowers gain and lenders lose because repayments have lower real value,Neither side is affected because contracts are fully indexed,Borrowers lose and lenders gain because repayments rise automatically,B,Unexpected inflation erodes the real value of nominal repayments benefiting borrowers and harming lenders.
Following a temporary demand boom what happens as expectations adjust over time,Output remains above potential permanently with the same price level,Both output and the price level revert to original values,Output returns to potential and the price level remains higher,Output falls below potential in the long run,C,In the long run wages and prices adjust so the economy returns to LRAS while the price level reflects the earlier demand increase.
Given Employed equals 16893 Unemployed equals 2973 Adult population equals 29944 what are the unemployment rate and the labour force participation rate,15.0 percent and 33.7 percent,15.0 percent and 66.3 percent,85.0 percent and 66.3 percent,66.3 percent and 15.0 percent,B,Unemployment rate is one hundred times U divided by the labour force and participation is one hundred times labour force divided by adult population.
If domestic interest rates fall relative to foreign rates capital flows will and the exchange rate will,Reverse repeatedly with no link to interest differentials,Show no reaction and the exchange rate will be fixed,Tend to flow in and the currency will appreciate,Tend to flow out and the currency will depreciate,D,Investors seek higher returns abroad when the domestic return is lower which reduces demand for the currency and weakens it.
If the Reserve Bank lifts the OCR during a demand boom which short run outcome is most likely,No effect on credit conditions,Higher investment and faster demand growth,Lower investment and slower growth in aggregate demand,A permanent fall in the natural rate of unemployment,C,A higher policy rate passes through to market rates making borrowing costlier and moderating interest sensitive spending.
Purchasing power parity suggests that over time a country with persistently higher inflation will experience,Currency depreciation relative to trading partners,Currency appreciation to offset higher prices,No change in the exchange rate,Higher real exchange rate with no nominal change,A,Higher domestic prices reduce competitiveness so the nominal exchange rate tends to depreciate to align price levels long run.
If immigration increases the number of qualified workers in a sector and product demand is unchanged what happens to wages in that sector,They stay fixed by definition,They rise because productivity always rises with more workers,They tend to rise because labour demand shifts left,They tend to fall because labour supply shifts right,D,A rightward shift in labour supply lowers the equilibrium wage unless offset by higher demand or productivity.
Which cost of inflation reflects the wasted resources spent managing cash balances and frequent transactions,Shoeleather costs,Menu costs,Relative price variability,Tax bracket distortions,A,When inflation is high people avoid holding cash by making extra trips or managing balances more actively which uses time and effort.
Expected inflation is 1 percent and the real interest rate is 1 percent what nominal rate is consistent with the Fisher equation,2 percent,3 percent,1 percent,4 percent,A,The Fisher relationship says nominal equals real plus expected inflation so add the two numbers to obtain the nominal rate.
During the Global Financial Crisis many banks cut lending because,There was no change in bank balance sheets,Demand for credit was unaffected but banks chose not to lend arbitrarily,Losses eroded bank capital and funding became costly which forced deleveraging,Central banks banned lending by regulation,C,Large losses on risky assets reduced capital and increased risk premiums which compressed lending capacity and tightened credit.
If the reserve ratio is 8 percent what is the simple money multiplier in a basic fractional reserve model,13,24,11,12,D,The simple multiplier equals one divided by the reserve ratio written as a fraction so compute one over R.
Which cost of inflation reflects the wasted resources spent managing cash balances and frequent transactions,Relative price variability,Menu costs,Shoeleather costs,Tax bracket distortions,C,When inflation is high people avoid holding cash by making extra trips or managing balances more actively which uses time and effort.
A binding minimum wage set above the market wage is most likely to,Lower unemployment because wages are higher,Shift labour demand right by itself,Leave employment unchanged in all cases,Create a surplus of labour and raise unemployment among affected workers,D,A wage floor above equilibrium raises the price of labour so quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded creating unemployment in that market.
